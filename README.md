# indivisual - VJ-Synthesizer

## What is it?
YEAH BABY!!! 

indivisual - VJ-Synthesizer is a rhythm based animation tool giving you the ability to have shapes dancing and flickering to the music.
The most settings can be "oscillated" so that different variations on how a shape is moved, rotatet, transformed, modified, colored, 
lit, sized, postprocessed, ... can be mixed in.  
There also is a mechanism to record samples and then mix them in sequences with different composite operations. 
Those sequences can be flipped, sliced, accelerated, slowed, ... and also cans be used as shape material.

To get an idea of what can be done with it, visit my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2QczAUG69575hFIRg2JDcQ)  


## Things you have to know
indivisual VJ-Synthesizer works best and also is only developed on google-chrome.
I tried it on firefox but the performance is bad. 

There is no clean code in there. There also is no explicit design pattern 
except a plugin concept designed by myself.

However i tried to cleanup and remove the messiest parts of it since i retired 
from my part time job as a VJ performing video life acts in some well known clubs in Munich.
I also retired from being a professional developer due to my inability 
to use popular programming techniques and design patterns.  

Therefore things do not work together perfectly sometimes.

But still it's pretty much fun to play with!

## Getting Started
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) 
- Or via npm: 
    ```
    npm install -g yarn
    ```
    On linux systems you might have to use sudo:
    ```
    sudo npm install -g yarn
    ```
- Execute the following lines in your command line within the installation directory:
    ```
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn start --port 8081
    ```
- Open http://localhost:8081/controller.html 
- Open http://localhost:8081 in a second window
- Split the two windows left and right
- Or open it as single page application http://localhost:8081/inline.html
- Try some of the setups from presets (controller->lowerleft)
- Play around

### Deprecated Powerful Features on Insecure (non SSL) Origins
When not running on localhost, it is not possible to use microphone or audio input without SSL.
- You can either run chrome with the --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure="http://example.com" flag (replacing "example.com" with the origin you actually want to test)
    like described in this [article](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins)
- Or you have to enable SSL

Server options can be found [here](docs/server-options.md)

### Understand
- A lot of settings are based on three.js settings. To understand these, you have to dig into three.js [docs](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)  

### Mapping
- Focus the animation or setup window 
- Enable mapping controls: M
- Show grid: B
- Focus next/another display: TAB/MOUSE1 
    - After a window resize event the mapping will not be updated until you open the mapping controls
    - You can recenter your mapping by enabling it by M and press TAB
- Move around: MOUSE1_DRAG or LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN 
- Press SHIFT + MOUSE1 any point to center the current display there
- Press 1-9 to center and resize 1st to 9th division of the preset resolution
    - SHIFT + 1-9 to does the same based on screen size
- Flip display: V/H
- Rotate 45Â°: R
- Rotate stepwise: ALT + LEFT/RIGHT
- Scale: ALT + UP/DOWN

### Samples & Sequences
- ... awesome ...
- Slow on GPUs but fast on INTEL's internal graphics cards

### Shape-Editor
This feature is tricky to use. 
But for some cases it does its job pretty well. 
Have a look at presets/_demos.

- In the controller, set shape_geometry to custom
- Open http://localhost:8081/setup.html
- Press S to enable shape controls
- ... more explanation here ...

### MIDI Controllers
- If you own a [Arturia Beatstep](https://www.arturia.com/beatstep/overview), simply connect it. If the device uses factory settings, it will work immediately and the layout will just work fine.
- Otherwise you have to build up your own layout. Have a look at [MidiController.yml](app/structure/MidiController.yml) 
- ... more explanation here ...  

### Plugins
indivisual comes with a set of funny plugins. Nevertheless you might want to extend it with some of your own ideas.
In this case you can add your own plugins for the most settings available.
